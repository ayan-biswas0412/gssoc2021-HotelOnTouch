## Getting Help

Got a problem? Ask your mentors, ask other students, or ask the community.

Our community is not so large so we value each and every persons and want to enlarge the community. Everyone else
you talk with may be a non-mentor.

Students should keep in mind that some people are non-mentors,
and cannot see the contest progress, dates, or information
about students. When communicating widely, be sure to;

 - Introduce yourself, the first time,
 - Talk about the task as if you want to do it yourself, not
   because of the contest,
 - Defend your technical decisions without using the contest as
   a defense,
 - Non-mentors may give good guidance on technical decisions,
   but bad guidance on how they think a task is judged. Always
   consult with your mentors as well.

## Useful Resources

- [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- [Node.js Docs](https://nodejs.org/api/)
- [Git and GitHub](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-git-a-reference-guide)


## Community etiquette

Everyone in the community has to be polite and respectful, and
consider everyone else a member of a team and not a competitor.

One should be considerate to everyone else's time. We would like
to have quality discussions, and not answer questions that are
already documented, or available on stackoverflow. This doesn't
mean you can't ask questions, but a clueless user and a lazy
developer are two different things.

Tell things as you see them. Be polite, but don't sugar coat it.
You don't have to apologize everytime you make a mistake; but
avoid repeating it again ;-)

### We are ready to hear from you for any suggestions will help us, Please feel free to open a issue
